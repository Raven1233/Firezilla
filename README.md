# Search Engine using NextJs + Tailwind CSS:-
Firezilla is a search engine that has been developed using Google search API. The app has been developed on NEXT JS, alongwith Tailwind CSS that has been used for styling. The app also features Pagination to check out the different search results that get displayed.


# What i learnt in this project:-
1) Using Google's search API .
2) Better understanding of how to use environment variables and routing in Next JS.
3) Better understanding of Talwind CSS(especially on how to create gradient backgrounds).


I will later host this app later.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
